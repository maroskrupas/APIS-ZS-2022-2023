    "### Scenario/Background\n",
    "Detecting moving objects in a scene is one of the most important tasks in computer vision. It is useful for video surveillance, for instance, but it is usually the basis for other, more complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the way this task is performed is by building a model of an empty scene and comparing each newly captured frame to it. When the model of the empty scene is different from the current scene, it means that something in the image has changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to use a video camera attached to the Raspberry Pi to capture videos and images. We will build a very simple background model that will allow us to detect changes in the scene that the camera is capturing. We are capturing the images and converting them into matrices of numbers that can be operated on mathematically. This is different from capturing images and saving them as files.\n",
    "### Required Resources\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "* 1 PC with Internet access\n",
    "* Raspberry Pi version 2 or higher\n",
    "* Python libraries: numpy, cv2, picamera, time, pyplot, numpy\n",
    "* Picamera V2 module\n",
    "\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi camera module was connected and installed in a previous lab. This lab assumes that the installation and testing of the camera module have previously been completed."

    "Let's have a look at the kind of data we are going to work with: digital images and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital image is a matrix composed of pixels. Each pixel corresponds to a position inside of the image and contains information regarding the color of the image at that location. If the image is grayscale, each pixel contains a number that identifies the `level of gray` in that position. If we are looking at a color image, then each pixel contains a vector that encodes a color according to a certain color map. For instance, if we are using the RGB color map, each color is encoded by a group of three numbers. The numbers reprent the quantity of red, blue and green that makes up the color of the pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we want to compare what we see versus what the computer sees, it would be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Images/lisa_n.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pixel in an image that is using the RGB color space has three RGB values that range from 0 to 255 that define the color of that pixel. An image that is 256 pixels high and 256 pixles wide has 65,536 pixels. Each pixel has 24 bits of color information associated with it in an RGB color space. (The 24 bits consist of eight bits each for the red, green, and blue color channels.) The figure shows a numeric array that represents a 16x16 pixel area of the larger image. The values in the numeric array for each pixel represent the red value in that pixel. The pixels also have green and blue values that are not shown for clarity. The combination of the red, green, and blue values can depict 16,777,216 color variations (256 to the third power).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision is a demanding computer task, and it requires a lot of work in terms of pre-processing to transform a raw digital image into a form that is understandable by a computer as data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution of an image (or a video) is the number of pixels contained in the image (or each frame), and it is usually expressed by the number of rows and the number of colums (e.g, 256x256 means that an image has 256 rows and 256 columns of pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital video is a sequence of frames, and each frame is a digital image. Digital videos can have different frame rates that are expressed as the number of images per second. Video standards vary, but a full-motion digital video is usually around 30 frames per second. Other frame rates can be used depending on the purpose of the video and the amount of bandwidth and storage that are available."

    "## Part 4: Explanation and Application\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "The line of code that is at the heart of this process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`plt.imshow((np.absolute(bg-image)>threshold), cmap='gray')`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take this code apart to see what is happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we know that we have imported `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`. We can see from the use of the `matplotlib.pyplot` method `plt.imshow()` that this line of code will display whatever is defined by its arguments. The second argument in the method, `cmap ='gray'`, indicates that `matplotlib.pyplot` will display the image in the grayscale color space. So, what is it going to display? \n",
    "\n",
    "The image to be displayed is specified by the first argument of the `pyplot` method. This argument is expressed as an inequality, which evaluates to either `True` or `False`. We can see three variables that are present within this statement. They are `bg`, `image`, and `threshold`. `bg` is the background image we created by mathematically averaging pixel matrices of 10 image captures. `image` is the matrix of pixel values that makes up the current image in the image sequence that is being captured in the `while` loop. Because the background image and current images are both represented as matrices of numeric gray scale values, mathematical operations can be performed on them. In this case, the `image` matrix is subtracted from the background (`bg`) image matrix. What this means is that every pixel grayscale value (range = 0 to 255) in the current image is subtracted from the value in the background image for the corresponding pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are looking only for change as expressed by the amount of difference between each pixel, the `numpy` absolute value function, `np.absolute()`, is used to find the amount of change. This accomodates any values that are negative. This value is then compared to the `threshold` variable. If the value for the pixel is greater than the threshold value, the argument for the function evaluates as True. This means the pixel is significantly different from the background reference image. This results in the pixel being displayed as pure white in the Change Detection image. All pixels that have been determined to be unchanged (less than the threshold value) are displayed as black. In other words, `pyplot` is displaying an array of True or False values as a black and white image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the process can be calibrated by manipulating the `threshold` value. For example, if a new image is captured that is the same as the background reference image, the entire image should display as black because no change would be detected. Any white pixels displayed in the Change Detection image can be considered as “noise” in this situation. If there is a considerable amount of white in the Change Detection image, the threshold value could be increased until less noise is detected as change. If the threshold value is adjusted correctly, the Change Detection image should be mostly solid black when the background and current images are essentially the same.\n",

    "Go into the code in the cell above and experiment with changing the value of the `threshold` variable. Run the cell and allow it to capture a few images. What happens to the Change Detection image if the value is too high? Too low?"

    "#### Application\n",
    "Digital video cameras have become inexpensive, plentiful, and practical to use. Video cameras that are connected to networks can be seen in many cities and businesses. Some of these cameras are connected to the Internet. The streams of video data that they produce are processed and analyzed at the network edge or in the Cloud. What is this video data used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious application is for security and surveillance. Basic change detection algorithms like the one demonstrated in this lab could be used to detect the actions of people or the movement of things. Change detection can be used to detect when parking places become vacant or when store shelves are empty. In traffic management, a change detection process can be used to compare the current conditions on a highway to the expected conditions for that time and day. A differrence may indicate a traffic jam in or near the area that the camera is monitoring. This could be used to alert public safety personnel of the need to investigate road conditions.\n",

    "Can you think of any other applications for analysis of video data and change detection?"
