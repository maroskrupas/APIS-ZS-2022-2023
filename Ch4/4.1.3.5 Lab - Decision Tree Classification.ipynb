Each root and intermediate node contains the decision factor, the entropy, and the number of passengers who fit the critierion at that point in the tree. For example, the root node indicates that there are 891 observations that make up the learning data set. At the next level, we can see that 577 people were male, and 314 were female. In the third level, at the far right, we can see that 415 people were male and paid a fare of less than 26.2686. Finally, the leaf nodes for that intermediate node indicate that 15 of these passengers were below the age of 13.5, and the other 400 were older than that age.\n",

For example, in nodes in which the decision results in equal values in the survival value array, the entropy is at its highest possible value, which is 1.0.
